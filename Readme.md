# Week 3 Assignment 

1) Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
2) Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

## Result.py

-  A Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The discount is applied only if it is 20% or higher.

### How It Works

1) Function calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)

    - Returns the discounted price if discount â‰¥ 20%, otherwise returns the original price.

2)  User Input

    - Prompts for the original price and discount percentage.

3) Final Price

    - Calls the function and prints either the discounted price or the original price if no discount applies.
